# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
### Module 20 Challenge
#### Project Overiew
With skills learned in this module regarding machine learning and neural networks to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if applicants will
be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Using the provided CSV to preprocess data for a neural network model, compile and train the model, and finally create an
optimized version of the first model created. along with the written analysis (README.md)
#### Deliverables
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
4. A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)
#### Results
Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
### Summary
 Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation
