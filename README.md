# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
### Module 20 Challenge
#### Project Overiew
With skills learned in this module regarding machine learning and neural networks to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if applicants will
be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

#### Objectives
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model

#### Results
##### Data Preprocessing
-What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
Application Tyle and Income Amount
-What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
Ask Amount
-What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Affiliation, Use Case, Orginaization, Special Considerations
##### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

-Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was not able to meet the target performance
-What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I added an additional layer and changed the activations as well as incresead the number of epochs to increase the model performance
